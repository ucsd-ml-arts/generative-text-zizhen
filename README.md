## Abstract

This project I will work on one type of chinese fantasy novel such as swordsman stories. A lot of American people like Asian novel or fiction because these novels are different from American novels. My learning data is from a website which some volunteers transform the novel to English version. I want our module could learn some specific seeting or scenario and generate some chinese fantsy novel. My tranning data is a book called Coiling Dragon which is very popular chinese fantasy novel in America. I plan to use RNN model to generate the text. My goal is the generating text would keep the same interesting setting like people could practice their douqi(a internal energy) to increase their levels and beat with stronger enemies.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
