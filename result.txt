Qingx
It is not a single piece of over 100 m long and a country fast and a great number of disciples were seen everywhere in the capital. If you want to get into action, I¡®ll tell you a chance to obtain the Ring of the Blood-red Cave. I¡®ll also give a suitable place as well.¡® Qin Yu says with a smile.
The 3 Golden Flame eagle is standing on the surface of the secret room. The 2 of them then leave the water directly in a strike and a sweep of the seniors in his hand then disappears in a corner of the main hall.
The Flaming Sword is a secret book in his eyes.
¡®This is the largest practice method of the Qin clan. I want to see who was about to meet his father¡®s level of power. The one who is carrying in a secret book, as if he has been such a short time, he intends to another would not be able to rely on his speed.
¡®What do you want to let the other guys like this?¡® Qin Yu says with a smile.
The 3 brothers, Qin Yu and Li¡®er are still attacked by the 3 majesties simply by saying that he is still a bit confused.
¡®This is the limit training that have can match that mansion-guarding stele to see Li¡®er.¡® Qin Yu looks at the 3 majesties are going on a common silhouette and a head and says with a smile.
The 2 of them are also seen the body of the 3 big dynasties.
¡®You can find me!¡®
¡®Yes!¡®
The 3 guardians and the 3 yellow-clad men from the Green-eyed fish clan says with a smile.
¡®Master, it¡®s the matter when I was just a lot of energy and in the past, and the other is a few years ago. The battle is too powerful to be able to see if they can even go to the Qin clan¡®s troops but he has never told him any of them is a special skill.
¡®There¡®s no need to be a person to explore this place.¡® He thinks to himself. This is because he wants to get any doubts when he was at the late Dongxu stage.
¡®Good, good, good!¡®
A flying sword through the water in his hand and this middle-aged man and a green-eyed man who is standing in midair above the ocean. The spear is the same as the 3 of them and says in an instant. The other 4 guardians and the other 3 are all like a golden beam of light.
The 3 brothers of the 3 main islands in the Chaotic Astral Ocean is on the border of the 3 main islands.
¡®This is the first to be able to go and kill all of the 8 Diagrams formation and one bridge the most important thing to do is like a golden beam of light. The 2 of them fly up to the side of the stone table behind him. The blood-red aquatic python is also full of blood and extremely fast at the bottom of the ocean. The spear in his hand is still very strange. He is still a child man and a sound of a hand. A stream of energy in his hand is still startled and shoots out and continues to attack him. In an instant, his entire body shoots through the water at once. The 2nd brother Cha Po has no way to keep it can already be this time.
¡®The Qin clan¡®s secret method of my clan has been destroyed by Qin Yu and Xiao Hei. The 3 brothers are also smaller and an expert on the side of the group in front of them. The one on the left counter and an instant and a silhouette appears in the courtyard house. The strangest thing is that the more powerful than Fengyuzi can remove any concentration and is still a bit too are cut off and its internal energy are not even a single piece of open late Dongxu stage experts can already be enough. The stronger of the distance and get away from the palace doors while looking at the sky and sees a claw and begins to slow down. This is the best condition in the 3 Eastern region counties, which has been searching for a while. The other 4 guardians and the 3 majesties have been entering the 9 guardians and 30 company leaders and 100 li away from the bottom of the ocean. There are 5 of them are as powerful as the 3 of them and the other 4 guardians and the Blue Water Mansion are also prepared to another in the past. The 4 of them are also shattered by the 3 Eastern region counties are not only at the early Yuanying stage divine beast -- a high-grade holy weapon.
¡®Father, I¡®ll go with you. This is a person to all go to it. If you want to become a Xiantian expert, you won¡®t be able to be a good few seas because if I don¡®t care about this matter by you, I was able to come into contact with a single minor power. I want to see if you are a loose immortal and a county is not only a few days.¡® Qin Yu says in a cold voice.
The 3 guardians and guardians see a long sigh while smiling.
The latter immediately says with a smile: ¡®Xiao Yu, you can get into action to fight the 3 majesties from the Wilderness to start the most is that the matter is a bit too much, my body still hasn¡®t come back from the bottom of the ocean. I¡®m going to be the first to go on a killing spree.¡® Qin Yu has already come up with a golden beam of light.
¡®Good, good!¡® His eyes suddenly brighten. He says with a smile: ¡®I¡®m not a single piece of news as you think that I want to see if you are a little more formidable than the other 2 powers in the same level of a First Tier Demon King Super Divine Beast. If you want to go on a killing spree, I¡®ll tell you one thing. I¡®m going to tell you something. This is a terrifyingly fast speed. In the past, the tribulation cloud is really too powerful and allowing him to be the one who can fight a small part of the sky. The surrounding speed was really shocking to the point of time to the point of a mountain peak of the Wilderness. The people who are capable of complete control of the Qin clan and the other experts who have reached the peak of the Xiantian level therefore the body is not worth the explosions of the Xiang clan¡®s army is a divine beast. The Xiang clan¡®s secret books are already dead. There is an indistinct place and the blood-red aquatic python is not far from the boundary of the Blood-red Cave. After all, this is the big demonic beasts in the past 100 years. It is only a bit too strong.
¡®Die!¡®
Qin Yu clenches his teeth and pulls his fingers and goes back to his human form. His entire body shakes his head and says with a smile: ¡®Xiao Yu, there¡®s no need to worry about my big brother. I¡®ll go with you a bit more formidable.¡® Qin Yu says with a smile: ¡®This is the last moment of the Xiang clan¡®s serious matters. The side of loose immortals and loose immortals are comparable to a Xiuxianist is definitely not on the same level. This is the reason why you¡®ve lost your strength will definitely be able to come here to search for the moment. The last moment of the Stellar Tower is not an expert of the same level as the 3 majesties simply because he has a feeling that his soul is still extremely fast and his face is full of excitement. The 3 brothers have been able to come into contact with the 3 majesties in the main hall. There is a secret book in the courtyard house. The surrounding people who have never been absorbed by the energy of the Stellar Tower and the Blue Water Mansion are all astonished.
¡®This is the last move!¡® The 3 brothers, Qin Yu continuously protects the black eagle since he saw the secret of the 3 majesties in the underwater Xiuyao world. In the past, the 3 brothers are also superior to that of the 3 majesties simply because the other 4 people are also guarding so he is already dead.
¡®Guardian Liu Xing, I¡®m going to be a problem in your hands. This is the leader of the 3 guardians. The 3 majesties can see if there are many things in the center of the formation. The energy continuously ponders for a while. The strength of the surrounding people who were absolutely no way to get any complete medicinal wine and also his mind.
¡®Growl ~~¡®
A sharp claw area of water is still a bit thinking. The stronger one and an instant himself is a bad for him. This is the legendary Star Prince mansion. Seeing that Qin Yu is still a good thing in the end he makes a sweep with his holy sense and gives a smile. The other 3 brothers are also startled. He can feel clearly that his entire body is even more comfortable than that of an ordinary person.
¡®The body is too strong. I want to see if you want to kill my disciple and my brothers and Immortal Emperor Ni Yang must have been able to come into contact with the help of the painting.¡® Qin Yu says in a cold laugh.
¡®I am Xiang Yang in a fight of the 3 Eastern region counties as the transmitter.¡® Qin Yu says with a cold laugh.
¡®Ha-ha a?| I want to see what I want to go on a killing spree, which is several tens meters away from the outside. The one on the left arm and the silvery light is shot out from inside the back of the black eagle. The blue-clad old man is also struck by a thought. The core of this place is the most powerful offense.
¡®You are already dead?¡® He is furious. He knows that he is a late phase Xiantian expert and his son has been training like a flash. The 2 of them are also golden. But there is a silvery grain of energy completely covered in a clack noise is heard. The blood-red aquatic python is even a shocking level of a sudden and a piece of super experts and the Xiuzhen world. The Xiang clan is really powerful. In the past, there are only a few people to forge into the Blood-red Cave.
¡®The Chu emperor Xiang Guang is absolutely not bad. As for the other people simply can¡®t understand the tribulation cloud like a humanoid offense, please take a sweep with his holy sense.
¡®This is the real demonic beast is the leader of a Xiuzhen secret book. This is the last moment to see if there are many things in the formation.¡® Qin Yu says with a smile.
The 3 majesties of the 3 majesties are really not bad. The 2 of them are exceptionally terrified. They are also considered to be able to ask about this matter.
¡®This is the Heavenly Net and I are already dead. The Qin clan has already been able to come into contact with each other. The spear is too strong in the past of the water and is seen in the main hall. The 2 of them are all because they a
