    "\"Neural Nets\" are loosely inspired on neurobiology. Now people call them units, nodes, etc., as opposed to \"neurons\". Each unit has a number of inputs (with weights), an activation function, a bias (offset), and an output. These weights and biases are the trainable parameters of the network that can be \"learned\".\n",

    "Each unit has an activation function, a bias, and ever connection going in or out of the node has a weight. All of these are trainable parameters of the network. For the image above, we have 9 neurons, with 32 connections (each with weight), 9 biases. This makes for 41 trainable parameters). This diagram is a fully connected network (each node connects to every node on the next layer). We call this a feed-forward network, because input data (at the left) is propogated / \"feeds forward\" from node to node in layer to layer, producing outputs (at the right).\n",

The blood-red aquatic python is even a shocking level of a sudden and a piece of super experts and the Xiuzhen world. The Xiang clan is really powerful.

    "  - How does changing the number of RNN units (internal \"nodes\" in the LSTM) change the results? By default we have ```rnn_units = 1024```\n",
    "  - Does changing the length of training sequences ```seq_length = 100``` change the results? \n",
    "  - Add a new layer to your network (copy the rnn statement in the model construction)\n",
    "4. Future directions: \n",
    "  - Move on to a word-level RNN model (like this https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow)\n",
    "  - Move on to fine-tuning the GPT-2 model (https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2, https://pmbaumgartner.github.io/blog/gpt2-jokes/)"
