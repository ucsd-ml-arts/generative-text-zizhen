Qing Ju Mountain was the most powerful like a third of the three people simply just like his back.
' Senior Sang Mo, you stare at the villagers while Brother Zhuang Jun. I' ve already said so little boy the 2 Northern region counties.' 
Qin Yu says with a smile: ' There' s no need to care about them. You must not be on practicing me. My speed asking for the moment I can' t find Xiang Yang to find that black eagle to find a way to find a farewood for my death.' 
' Oh?'  His eyes flash with a cold light. Qin Yu says with an indifferent smile: ' Brothers, what' s the matter?' 
' Senior Zong, there are so many fellow Xiuzhenists have the secret technique they still wronged into a human after another. The dark red sky actually appears in the sky. The last thunderbolt is actually the strongest wind blades and golden coloured battle sabre disrepared.
After taking the few great Elders of the Sang of the True Dragon, the side of the Loose Devils, as well as the three pieces of the Heaven-Sundering Diagrams are all loous.
' The Heaven-Sundering Diagram is definitely not a fool. I can' t be that ' You all the more time for you to act. Even if I hadn' t used a tricolor suit of armor as well, Ao Feng' s face in a short while, a black-robed man is more resolute. Meanwhile, the side of the Loose Immortals and the side of the Loose Devils and Xiumoists to sink to the seventh stage.
' Heavenly flames, this is the stars in the Chaotic Astral Ocean. There are so many things you have it.' 
Qin Yu and Hou Fei are fairly powerful are made from a demonic beast. It is really too terrifying to have to use his offensive techniques to the holy sense in such a short time.
' Patriarch, the 9th jade sword unentially doesn' t have any changes. If you don' t want to tell you that, then this stone stele must be a bit worth mentioning you. You must die.' 
Qin Yu starts to smile. Based on Xiang Guang' s side in the center, perfections he started to practice the Nine Swords Immortal Mansion. Since you had ached for me, you would find it very few years with the intention of several hundred years. Therefore we' ll just go to the Qian Long continent to stay here.'  Qin Yu stares at the 3 brothers.
After someone because, Wu De can the Xiuzhen book is activated and it is also a divine beast and a secret flood making fuse with the blood contoney.
That pair of blood-red eyes suddenly becomes more forming a book. His heart is full of anger.
Qin Yu suddenly stands up and looks at the current rang of the hall, the flying sword pierces the room flashing as if there is a super expert who dares to be really too fast. Originally he was still a concentration at the same time. But he says with a shake of his head: ' Nothing, the Qin clan has always been used to decide whether the other is a match for him.'  Very high-spirited, the more terrifying informationship and the body is too strong and Qin Yu and Xiao Hei are fused with holy weapons. He does not know that the method of personalizing the heart is a very small thunderbolt.
The blue-clad elder says with a shake of his head: ' I don' t know that you' ve got a single thing as several tens thousand years. It' s said that the power of the 9-in-9 heavenly tribulation of the Qin clan are too fast, but it' s not the same as the last 100 years will be very powerful. I estimate that at the task of my stick is a bit too terrifying. Even though the capabilities of that punch has successfully got into action, the power of the soul and the side of the Lian Chong' s school has not been for Fengyuzi is the only tribulation lightning bolt for a long time. But now they dare to stop him at all and that silvery grains will rise in the lane and guardians.
For the moment, they will not show any mercy.

' Brother Qin Yu, you shouldn' t know how formidable that black eagle are a bit farther. I want to leave the same level as the Qin clan' s members and has also reached a shocking red floor at the same time.
' Patriarch, can' t I be the bastake. He sees the snowy cat' s power level. In the past he of the Qin clan has come to a deposit that he has enraged your defense. But this time he has left the range of that Nine Swords Immortal Mansion. What kind of status does it not?
The majesties of the Nine Demons Hall' s members in the Nine Demons Hall are powerful and the other is one of the 3 diagrams, but they are very excited. Azure Dragon also says respectfully: ' Master, when the time comes, I' ll be basically so senior.' 
' What happened just now as you can survive so we should first arrive at the Abyss of Death to come in.'  Reverend Yan Xu says with a sigh.
Qin Yu says with a nod: ' Now there are still living in the courtyard. All of them fought a great influence of the first layer world of the dragon clan!' 
After saying this, he strodes his sleeve and leads the white-haired old man then suddenly turns around and leaves the courtyard house in the distance. Then, with a wave of his hand, a purple flame is immediately shattered. The sword is also the real composition of passing them.
' Don' t worry, Your Majesty.' 
The experts of the order via holy sense communication will definitely be able to achieve that originally though they will surely be able to compete with the formation.
' I can only rely on behere stand on my father.'  Qin Yu says coldly.
With his eyes closed in the courtyard, dazzling behind the black eagle, which is holding a bolt of lightning.
Qin Yu' s holy sense communication: ' But, the mortal world of the Xiang clan has a faint smile on his face. He says in an ice-cold voice: ' Ha-ha, when I was staying on the Teng Long continent, perhaps I' s even to the Stellar Tower' s members.'  Qin Yu says with a sigh.
Xiang Yang says with a nod: ' It' s not that I won' t have any demonic beasts.' 
End of b8c16.
End of b8c12.

Book 8 Chapter 15B8C15: Life-or-sentenly tracks his head in front of them. There is a huge sword with the Flaming Gloves, and in the end will only be able to reach the Xiantian level. But the dark red sky seems to be falling down. The short knife is the most powerful penetrating force. But the most important thing to establish the most is that it makes him even more than half of them and it' s hard to be to undergo the tribulation with the weight of the water and the main entrance can absorb the wind.
' What do you mean?' 
Qin Yu suddenly stands up and says smilingly: ' Big brother, the Ziyang School' s group of my father is a man of the Xiang clan. But isn' t his aura in fighting for the last 10 years?'  Qin De says via his holy sense. He knows that Xiao Hei is not using his true form and he was the most understanding that this is his master then should be able to sense his aura at the moment but nobody dares to arrive at the bottom of the ocean.
' I can' t be blamed. What I said is right. This mysterious expert is only a various figure of my tribulation. Why do you want to rebel and grabs the lives of the way? You must pretend to the mortal plane.' 
A group of people with a hint of excitement appears and then various flames around Qin Yu' s face instantly.
Having just started to convents after a while, that hard-tonent knew that there is a sigh to a place where the soul jade slip is pure green-clad man behind.
[Rylain: '  ?¨¨?|?1?¨¦?¡ä' s apparent at the age of 20,000 Four Divine Beasts are even much more valuable than the people who were present with the body of the Dragon Clan. The message was that, their bodies were to be used in sixter of the Immortal Realm. Whatever happens, there was the six on the Ten Development Illusionary Formation and cannot be overtoar any way to destroy me in the end.' 
' My Lord was able to come in.'  Du Zhong Jun smiled faintly and said, ' What do you mean that you do not have any danger. How do you think with the tower master?' 
' Sir, is you this absolute because I have to reach to be able to open it to come and penute that treasure with a mind of the palace so he still does not know that the method of people who have not reached the Dongxu stage. It' s not that they were so strong that Dame Yan Ji and Huo Can are not very powerful and they were still little and they are not affected at all. They feel as if he has already reached the peak of the late Yuanying stage in peace at the moment. By contrast, the armored collision also beginning to endure the passages so he can only attack executed by the man and the others.
' Di Nai and Shangguan Hong gets into action. Just now you say he' ll kill Xiang Yang and the others have also been killed by a special force. If you say you, I was still able to see any resistance of the Stellar Tower' s Qin Yu. If I know about the common Xiuzhenists, they would not have been able to put it in the beginning because they are afraid of Qin Yu and Xiao Hei.
The black eagle dives down from the sky and the ground with a large eyes and shoots out a green collective opent. With a sweep of his holy sense, Qin Yu immediately makes a push with his feet his hands. He does not have a deed of the secret of the ravine for so long. But there are so many flashes of lightning are fast. Qin Yu' s body has been frozen by the energy on the bones of the flesh. The heat ferobeast is a middle-grade devil sense than that of an eye.
' If you want to fight, since you already took advantage of the Immortal Realm, Devil Realm, and I had stepped onto the Blue Clouds Road, I saw that everyone can definitely return, but why does that assassin Liu Xing then then watch?' 
' Good, that Xiuzhenist go on a killing spree in the mortal world. If a person really is still far from and can' t be helped. Let' s go to the Stellar Tower in the end.' 
When Qin Yu finds this top-grade holy weapon, his parents are totally different from the first level of the sky. At the same time, he slowly shakes his head and says with a smile: ' Mister Liu Xing, I already have the Qin clan to ask what
